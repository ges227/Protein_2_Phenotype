<h1>
	WELCOME to the GES43 Protein to Phenotype Database!
	 

</h1>
	<p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">This database consists of proteins related to Malaria and Schizophrenia. </h2>

<hr>
<pre>
	You have successfully navigated to the Malaria and Schizophrenia database application, located at 
	<a href="http://localhost/BCHB697/ges43/ProjectPresentation.php" target="_blank">http://localhost/BCHB697/ges43/ProjectPresentation.php</a>
	What follows are set of helpful hints about how to navigate this website.
	As you saw on the home page, there are three main parts to my page: Website documentation, A Report Search Index, and a page outligning potential ways of improving this resource in the future.

	<div class="table-responsive">	
		<table class ="table">
			<tr>
				<td >
		The "Website Documentation" tab contains key links describing the practical applications of this website, the data sourced for this application, the logical model used for this databbase, instructions for deploying the database, and finally, the link to the how-to page that brought you here!</td>

		<tr>
			<td> The Data Model option of this tab menu will directed you to a page where the logical model can be downloaded in PDF Format. </td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> There are 5 different report options on this page. By Clicking where it is indicated, you will be redirected to the report page. In the example to the right, the report here outputs some overview information gathered for a specific protein entry, identified by it's Uniprot ID. As the text states, enter a UniprotKB ID of your choice, press enter, and if it is in this database, you'll soon be on your way to gathering a lot of information! This report additionally incorporates links to each protein's UniprotKB page, and it's HGNC gene page. </td>
			<td><img src="images/protoverview.png" ></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Another type of reporting interface is shown here. By clicking on the report to see different types of disease annotations, you are brought to this page, which features a drop down menu of different disease categories. By choosing one and pressing Go, you will obtain a list of proteins in the database that are annotated with a diseases of this category, if any such proteins exist. </td>
			<td><img src="images/disease.png" ></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td colspan=2> At any point during these analyses, pressing the Back to Home button will redirect you back to the home page, as shown above, where you can quickly toggle back to the report index and select any other question.</td>
