<ul>
	<li> <b>What is my data set?</b>
	<p> This data contains UniprotKB Protein entries, along with their disease annotations, gene information from the HGNC database, and disease entries from the disease ontology database. The protein data was found by searching for proteins implicated in Malaria and Schizophrenia.
	</p></li>
	
	<li> <b>Why did I select this data set?</b>
	<p> By collecting this data set of protein, gene and disease information, we can look at the the protein functions affected in Malaria and Schizophrenia and analyze them for any relations, and we can similarly observe any similarities or relationships between the diseases with which protein entries are annotated.
	</p></li>

	
	<li> <b>Where and how did I collect this data set?</b>
	<p> Uniprot entries were generated by using the advanced search to find proteins who had pathology/biotechnology-disease annotations of Schizophrenia, and by using Malaria as a simple search term. </p><p>The record pages of some these Uniprot Entry pages contained annotations to MIM entries from which data was gathered. The MIM Entry id's were entered into the disease ontology database to find additional disease classisfication information. </p> <p>The gene symbols of these proteins were also linked to corresponding HGNC entries from which data was gathered.  
	</p> 
	<p></p></li>

	<li> <b>What are the buisness rules or specifications of my data set?</b>
	<p> <ul>
		<li>Multiple piece of data (rows) can be collected by a person, but a piece of data (a row) can be collected by only one person.</li>
<li>A targeted disease can yield multiple uniprotKB entries. A uniprotKB entry number is always unique. </li>
<li>A uniprot entry can correspond to multiple diseases, but in this table, to only one targeted disease.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry has exactly only one uniprot url. This url can be derived from the uniprot entry number. It is unique to uniprot entry.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry must have exactly one full protein name. This is unique to a uniprot entry. It is also required for any uniprot entry.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry may have one set of Alternative names unique to the protein.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry must have one sequence length and one mass. Multiple entries may have the same sequence length or the same mass.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry must have one gene name. This is unique to a uniprot protein.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry must have exactly one HGNC ID. This is unique to the entry. It is accompanied by the HGNC URL, which is derivable from the HGNC ID, and also unique to one entry.</li>
<li>Each uniprot entry must have a unique HGNC approved symbol and approved name. Each must also have a unique set of HGNC synonyms.</li>
