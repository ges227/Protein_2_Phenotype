On this website, a series of reports can be found answering a set of bioinformatics questions.
These questions can be useful for users with specific biological, protein-related questions, to allow drawing hyoptheses.
For example, with knowledge of a specific type of disease that related to Schizophrenia or Malaria, or with a specific chromosome in mind, the dataset in this website can be searched for interesting results.</pre>
